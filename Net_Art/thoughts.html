            As I was going over the Arcangel Surfware, I was thinking about how creatives are able to create their own mediums digitally that hold virtual value. The thoughts from my previous assigmnent on Vannevar Bush's article "As We May Think" come to mind regarding the "Imagination Age" where creatives will be the forefront of the commercial industry; I feel that the Arcangel Surfware is an example of how creatives can create their own brands through digital platforms and be attributed value despite having no real utilitarian use.  Digital commerce is thriving more than ever through the acceleration of technology and it makes me think that the revolution is already starting to bloom. Things like NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are circulating throughout the virtual space and are generated mainly by artists that claim ownership of the tokens. Arcangel Surfware reminds me of this concept where Cory Arcangel's products (whether physical or digital) holds value similar to how NFT's work in a way. The value of NFTs and Cory Arcangel's works come from its exclusivity and the branding of the creator; the original maintains its value despite it being able to be reproduced and distributed.
