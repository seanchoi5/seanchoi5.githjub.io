            Cory Arcangel is an artist who practices his work in various forms of media which range from net art, music technology, and hacked game modifications. He specializes in tweaking with available technology to create his work, referred to as appropriation. A lot of his work mainly showcases the functionality of the technology he appropriates and serves no real utilitarian purpose. This brings his website, Arcangel Surfware, into mind as he founded it in 2014 as "a non-aspirational lifestyle brand" where he posts his products that are designed to be "useful for web surfing." This website essentially becomes a vessel for where he can output his creations for the public to view without the need of third party institutions or galleries to showcase his creations and merchandise.  He has even started up his own flagship store where he would host his own art galleries.
