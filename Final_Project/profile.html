                    <h1>My name is Sean Choi</h1>
                    <b>I’m a free-lance artist specializing at digital art, 2-D and 3-D animation, and web design.<br>
                        I’m currently a student in NYU Tandon School of Engineering.<br>
                        
                        As an Integrated Design and Media student from NYU Tandon, I studied in multiple facets of design, <br>art and technology that helped me garner stronger artistic sensibilities and acquire the necessary skills to execute on multiple creative projects.
                        <br><br>
                        Today, I work on illustrations on Procreate to hone and master my digital painting skills as well as satisfy my clients. 
                        <br>I am also learning web design on the side to create platforms for creatives like me.
